      <p>
        Light Rail in Canberra offers an exciting opportunity to transform Canberra and deliver a truly integrated transport system, which will provide more options in how Canberrans move around, which in turn will enrich lifestyles and enhance growth.
        <br>
The first stage of Light Rail will connect the fast growing area of Gungahlin, through Dickson to the City.
<br>
There are 13 stops along the 12km track including a terminus at each end of the route. Construction has already started and services will begin for the community in 2018.
<br>
"Light Rail will bring local employment and a new industry in light rail operations, maintenance and hospitality for the next 20 years. This will drive growth, and growth will generate vibrancy, diversity of employment and long-term sustainability - just like it has in other cities around the world." Saori Peguicha, Project Manager, Pacific Partnerships (part of the consortium delivering stage one).
